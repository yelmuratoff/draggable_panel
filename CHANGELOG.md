## 0.0.6
* 

## 0.0.5

* Now `child` is nullable in `DraggablePanel` widget. This is useful when you want to use `DraggablePanel` inside other stack widgets.

## 0.0.4

* The `DraggablePanelItem` and `DraggablePanelButton` models were removed and replaced with `Record`.
This was done to make the package easier to use. If you were using `DraggablePanel` in a package, you would need to import models for others that use your same package. Now, this is not necessary.

## 0.0.3

* Initial release.
